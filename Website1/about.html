	<p>My college Principal is very particular in appointing the lecturers. This is the reason nobody takes tuition classes after the college hours like students of other colleges. It is my firm belief that education is the best way to enlighten young minds and it can only be imparted in a good environment having prosperous thinking. My college has all what it takes.</p></div>
